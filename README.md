üé® Styling Options Available
1. CSS Class Styling - {text|className}

// In your translations:
title: 'Where {Every|text-purple-600 font-bold} Brain Learns {Differently|text-blue-600 font-bold}'

2. HTML Tags - <tag>content</tag>

// In your translations:
subtitle: 'Unlock the potential of <strong>neurodiverse learners</strong> with our <em>revolutionary platform</em>'

3. Span with Classes - <span class="className">content</span>

// In your translations:
description: 'Built <span class="text-red-600 font-semibold">with and for</span> the neurodiverse community'

üöÄ How to Use
Use tStyled() instead of t() for styled translations:

// Before (plain text):
<h1>{t('hero.title')}</h1>

// After (with styling):
<h1>{tStyled('hero.title')}</h1>

üìù Examples in Action

I've already updated several components to demonstrate this:
Hero Section

    Title with purple "Every" and blue "Differently"
    Subtitle with bold and italic emphasis
    Benefits with colored titles

Subject Realms

    Gradient animated title
    Styled subject descriptions with emphasis
    Learning approach sections with colored highlights

üéØ Supported HTML Tags

    <strong> - Bold text
    <em> - Italic text
    <b> - Bold text
    <i> - Italic text
    <u> - Underlined text

    <span class="..."> - Custom CSS classes

üåà Pre-built Styling Classes

I've added several utility classes you can use:

    text-highlight - Underline highlight effect
    text-glow - Glowing text effect
    text-shadow-lg - Large text shadow
    text-brand-gradient - Brand color gradient

üí° Usage Examples

// Color-coded difficulty levels
difficulty: {
  beginner: '{Beginner|text-green-600 font-medium}',
  intermediate: '{Intermediate|text-yellow-600 font-medium}',
  advanced: '{Advanced|text-red-600 font-medium}'
}

// Emphasized statistics
stats: '{94%|text-4xl font-bold text-green-600}',

// Mixed styling
welcome: 'Welcome back, {Alex|text-purple-600 font-bold}! üåü',

// HTML emphasis
description: 'Focus on <strong>conceptual mastery</strong> rather than memorization'

The system automatically detects whether your translation contains styling markers and renders them as proper React components with the specified classes or HTML tags. This gives you complete control over text styling while keeping translations organized and maintainable!
